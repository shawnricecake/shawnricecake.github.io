I obtained my PhD degree in ECE Department of [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) at Boston in August 2025, advised by Prof. [Yanzhi Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a7akgIEAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I received my M.S. degree at Northeastern University in 2020 and my B.S. degree at Nanjing University of Science and Technology in 2018.

[//]: # (My research interest is efficient deep learning, including pruning, quantization, NAS, and distillation with software hardware co-design on GPU, Mobile, FGPA, and ASIC.)
My research interests center on efficient deep learning, with a particular focus on optimizing large foundation models and diffusion models for text and visual generation. I emphasize scalability, latency reduction, and deployment efficiency across a wide range of hardware platforms, including GPUs, mobile devices, FPGAs, and ASICs.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell Tech of Cornell University, where I work with Prof. [Tianyi Chen](https://chen.tech.cornell.edu/).
