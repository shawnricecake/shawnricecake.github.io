I am a Ph.D. student in ECE Department of [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) at Boston, advised by [Yanzhi Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a7akgIEAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I received my M.S. degree at Northeastern University in 2020 and my B.S. degree at Nanjing University of Science and Technology in 2018.

My research interest is **Efficient AI** including pruning, quantization, NAS, and distillation with **Software Hardware Co-Design** on Mobile, FGPA, and ASIC.
